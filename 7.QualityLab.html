          <p class="para-spacing my-3">
            At TechnoTronix we pride ourselves on the consistent quality of the designs we carry out and ensuring our customers have all the tools and practical support they require to ensure the job is completed on time and budget. Our level of support and service throughout your project is just one reason why our customers return to us again and again.
          </p>
          <p class="para-spacing">
            We are dedicated to satisfying your requirements in every aspect of quality service and for this reason we are able to retain our customer base year on year.
          </p>
          <p class="para-spacing">Quality is at the heart of everything we do and we are continuously working to improve the standard of delivering the PCB assembly service to our clients, ensuring an outstanding level of precision and reliability with full audit. Each designer takes ownership for the quality of the work done by them and every stage of the process is subject to rigorous quality assurance procedures.</p>
          <p class="para-spacing">In addition, our office is approved as a secure design facility that is cleared to carry out Government contracts. Thus, years of experience and strict control over procedures ensure that all our services conform to the highest standard of quality.</p>

            CRX 1000 - X-Ray Machine
          </h3>
          <p class="para-spacing my-4">
            We have Photon Dynamics Superior X-ray (SX) Series which provides high-resolution and high magnification X-ray inspection capability in a flexible and compact workstation configuration. With its wide selection of X-ray sources, image intensifiers, sample manipulators and software, the SX Series is designed specifically to meet the special nondestructive inspection requirements for today's production, research development and quality assurance departments.
          </p>
          <p class="para-spacing my-4">
            The Quality equipments are equipped with Photon Dynamics' own RTI-580 image processing system, designed for processing real-time X-ray images. Powerful and easy to use, RTI imaging systems provide repeatable and accurate results for both production and research applications.

            Benchtop automated PCB inspection:
          </h5>
          <p class="para-spacing my-3">
            Nordson YESTECH's advanced 5 megapixel color camera imaging technology offers bench top PCB inspection with exceptional defect coverage. This bench top system inspects solder joints and verifies correct part assembly enabling users to improve quality and increase output. The optional four side viewing cameras add additional inspection capabilities found only on in-line systems.
          </p>
          <p class="para-spacing my-4">Programming the BX is fast and intuitive. Operators typically take less than 30 minutes to create a complete inspection program including solder inspection. The BX utilizes a standard package library to simplify training and ensure program portability across manufacturing lines. Programs created with the BX are also compatible with Nordson YESTECH's complete line of AOI systems.</p>
          <p class="para-spacing my-4">Advanced Fusion Lighting and newly available 5 megapixel image processing technology integrates several techniques including color inspection, normalized correlation and rule-base algorithms to provide complete inspection coverage with an extremely low false failure rate.</p>
          <p class="para-spacing my-4 fw-bold">The BX is equally effective for paste, pre / post-reflow and even final assembly inspection. Remote programming maximizes machine utilization and real-time SPC monitoring provides a valuable yield enhancement solution.</p>
