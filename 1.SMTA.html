            Surface mount technology (SMT) is the most commonly used process in
            the industry when it comes to Surface Mount (SMT) PCB Assembly. Not
            without any reason, it allows for components to be mounted directly
            on the surface mount PCB. The technique lends itself to
            miniaturization of assemblies, which is the order of the day. Also,
            SMT Assembly (Surface Mount Assembly) known for their high
            mechanical strength. The SMT printed circuit boards are a preferred
            choice for high-speed circuits. At Technotronix, we have over 40
            years of experience in SMT PCB Assembly. With automated SMT Assembly
            process our boards ensure optimal performance in the most
            challenging applications.

            Why Are We The Best SMT PCB Manufacturer?
          </h3>
          <ul class="list-content mx-3 my-3">
            <li>
              Quick production – The fact that the circuit boards don’t have to
              be drilled for assembly, means that production is far quicker.
            </li>
            <li>
              Higher circuit speeds – In fact, this is one of the major reasons
              that SMT is the technology of choice today.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fabrication automation – It lends itself to automation and its
              many benefits.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cost – Small sized components typically come at a lower cost than
              their through-hole counterparts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Density - They allow for more components to be positioned on both
              sides of the SMT printed circuit boards.
            </li>
            <li>
              Design flexibility – It is possible to combine through-hole and
              SMT assembly manufacturing to offer greater functionality.
            </li>
            <li>
              Improved performance – SMT connections are more reliable and hence
              the boards make for improved performance.

              APPLICATION OF SMT ASSEMBLY (SURFACE MOUNT ASSEMBLY)
            </h3>
            <p class="para-spacing my-3">
              Surface Mount technology is actually the most commonly used
              process when it comes to electronic SMT Assembly. Its application

                      A surface mount device (SMD) is referred as an electronic
                      component that is mounted on a Printed circuit board. In
                      contrast, surface mount technology (SMT) relates to the
                      method used to place electronic components on PCBs.
